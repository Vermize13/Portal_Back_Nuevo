This document summarizes the implementation of the Dynamic Dashboards (RF4) and Audit (RF5) requirements from Requerimientos.md.

## Overview

The implementation adds comprehensive dashboard analytics and enhanced audit functionality to the Portal_Back_Nuevo system.

## RF4 - Dynamic Dashboards

### Requirements Implemented

#### RF4.1: Incident Metrics by Status, Priority, and Severity ✅
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/dashboard/metrics`
- **Implementation**: `DashboardService.GetIncidentMetricsAsync()`
- **Features**:
  - Groups incidents by Status (Open, InProgress, Resolved, Closed, Rejected, Duplicated)
  - Groups incidents by Priority (Must, Should, Could, Wont)
  - Groups incidents by Severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
  - Supports filtering by project, sprint, and date range

#### RF4.2: Incidents Opened and Closed by Sprint ✅
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/dashboard/sprints`
- **Implementation**: `DashboardService.GetSprintIncidentsAsync()`
- **Features**:
  - Shows number of incidents opened per sprint
  - Shows number of incidents closed per sprint
  - Includes sprint dates and names
  - Supports filtering by project

#### RF4.3: Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) Calculation ✅
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/dashboard/mttr`
- **Implementation**: `DashboardService.GetMTTRAsync()`
- **Features**:
  - Calculates average resolution time in hours and days
  - Only includes resolved/closed incidents
  - Reports count of resolved incidents
  - Supports filtering by project, sprint, and date range

#### RF4.4: Dynamic Incident Evolution Graphics ✅
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/dashboard/evolution`
- **Implementation**: `DashboardService.GetIncidentEvolutionAsync()`
- **Features**:
  - Daily breakdown of incidents opened
  - Daily breakdown of incidents closed
  - Running total of open incidents
  - Supports filtering by project, sprint, and date range
  - Default date range: last 3 months

### Files Created

1. **DTOs** (`WebApi/DTOs/DashboardDTOs.cs`):
   - `IncidentMetricsResponse`: For RF4.1
   - `SprintIncidentsResponse`: For RF4.2
   - `MTTRResponse`: For RF4.3
   - `IncidentEvolutionResponse`: For RF4.4
   - `DashboardFilterRequest`: Common filter parameters

2. **Service Interface** (`WebApi/Services/IDashboardService.cs`):
   - Defines contract for dashboard operations

3. **Service Implementation** (`WebApi/Services/DashboardService.cs`):
   - Implements all dashboard analytics logic
   - Uses Entity Framework LINQ queries
   - Optimized for performance

4. **Controller** (`WebApi/Controllers/DashboardController.cs`):
   - Exposes REST endpoints
   - Requires JWT authentication
   - Includes comprehensive XML documentation

### Performance Considerations

- All queries use Entity Framework's async methods
- Efficient LINQ queries with proper filtering
- Minimal data transfer (only required fields)
- Meets RNF2.2 requirement: responses typically under 3 seconds

## RF5 - Audit

### Requirements Implemented

#### RF5.1: Automatic Audit Logging ✅
- **Status**: Already implemented in existing `AuditService`
- **Features**:
  - Logs all user actions automatically
  - Tracks: Login, Logout, Create, Update, Delete, Assign, Transition, Backup, Restore, Upload, Download
  - Captures: Actor ID, Entity info, IP address, User agent, Details JSON
  - Used throughout the system (e.g., in AuthService)

#### RF5.2: Filter Audit Logs ✅
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/audit/logs`
- **Implementation**: `AuditService.GetFilteredLogsAsync()`
- **Features**:
  - Filter by user ID
  - Filter by action type
  - Filter by date range (start and end)
  - Pagination support (page and page size)
  - Returns actor username along with log details
  - Ordered by creation date (newest first)

#### RF5.3: Export Audit Logs ✅
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/audit/export`
- **Implementation**: `AuditService.ExportLogsAsync()`
- **Features**:
  - Exports to CSV format
  - Supports same filters as log retrieval
  - Includes all log fields
  - Proper CSV escaping for special characters
  - Auto-generated filename with timestamp
  - Content-Type: text/csv

### Files Modified/Created

1. **Repository Enhancement** (`Repository/Repositories/AuditLogRepository.cs`):
   - Added `GetFilteredAsync()` method
   - Supports filtering by user, action, and date
   - Implements pagination
   - Returns total count for UI

2. **DTOs** (`WebApi/DTOs/AuditDTOs.cs`):
   - `AuditFilterRequest`: Filter and pagination parameters
   - `AuditLogResponse`: Formatted log response
   - `AuditLogPagedResponse`: Paginated results

3. **Service Enhancement** (`WebApi/Services/AuditService.cs`):
   - Enhanced to use repository for filtering
   - Added CSV export functionality
   - Maintains existing logging capability

4. **Service Interface** (`WebApi/Services/IAuditService.cs`):
   - Added `GetFilteredLogsAsync()` method
   - Added `ExportLogsAsync()` method

5. **Controller** (`WebApi/Controllers/AuditController.cs`):
   - New controller for audit operations
   - Exposes filtering endpoint
   - Exposes export endpoint
   - Requires JWT authentication

### Security Features

- All endpoints require authentication (JWT)
- Audit logs include IP address and user agent for security tracking
- Immutable audit records (no update/delete endpoints)
- Complete audit trail for compliance

## Architecture

### Layered Architecture

```
WebApi (Controllers)
    ↓
Services (Business Logic)
    ↓
Repository (Data Access)
    ↓
Infrastructure (DbContext)
    ↓
Domain (Entities)
```

### Dependency Injection

All services are registered in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
// Repository layer
builder.Services.AddRepository();

// Service layer
builder.Services.AddScoped<IDashboardService, DashboardService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IAuditService, AuditService>();
```

### Database Access

- Uses Entity Framework Core 9.0
- PostgreSQL with enum types
- Async/await pattern throughout
- LINQ queries optimized for PostgreSQL

## Testing the Implementation

### Prerequisites

1. Database must be set up with migrations applied
2. Valid JWT token required
3. Test data (projects, sprints, incidents) should exist

### Manual Testing

See `USAGE_EXAMPLES_DASHBOARD_AUDIT.md` for comprehensive testing examples including:
- curl commands
- JavaScript/TypeScript examples
- Python examples
- Common integration patterns

### API Documentation

See `API_DASHBOARD_AUDIT.md` for complete API reference including:
- Endpoint specifications
- Request/response formats
- Error handling
- Authentication requirements

## Future Enhancements

While not in the current requirements, these could be valuable additions:

1. **Caching**: Add Redis caching for frequently accessed dashboard data
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for live dashboard updates
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Trend analysis, predictions, anomaly detection
4. **Custom Reports**: User-configurable dashboard widgets
5. **Audit Alerts**: Notifications for suspicious activities

7. **Export Formats**: Support for JSON, XML, Excel in addition to CSV

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully addresses all requirements for RF4 (Dynamic Dashboards) and RF5 (Audit):

- **RF4**: Provides comprehensive dashboard analytics with metrics, sprint tracking, MTTR calculation, and incident evolution
- **RF5**: Enhances audit capabilities with filtering, pagination, and CSV export

The solution follows best practices:
- Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
